# SUDOKU (terminal game)

WORK COMPLETED

my attempt at a sudoku game using a class. Still just learning. 
I have completed this project. User is able to play the game and it will reset the board to original values if you choose to play again.
has been written on a macOS using VScode. <br />

<br />This is how it appears in the terminal.
You enter a row and then it asks for a column as well, then you enter a number for that position<br />

<br />You then just play the game as normal. It will make sure that each row, column and each grid you choose will not <br />
Have a number already in that row, column or 3x3 grid, one example below<br />

<br />The it will ask you if you want to play again once every spot on the board has been filled, and resets the game back<br />
back to its original state.<br />
